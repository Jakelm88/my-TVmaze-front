# My TVmaze front app

This app is a simple UI using the TVmaze API.
On the home page, you can find a search bar. By clicking on search, you will be presented with 10 tv shows corresponding to your entry.
Soon, clicking on a show image will bring you to a page presenting you with information about the show (network, summary, ...)
